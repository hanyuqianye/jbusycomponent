= Introduction =
We will introduce how use the `JBusyComponent` as a JavaBean in the palette manager.
And layout and configure the `JBusyComponent` with Matisse

= Configuring your netbeans =
Theses steps are done only one times and apply for your whole netbeans environment

== Creating required Netbeans' libraries ==

=== The JBusyComponent library ===
 * Menu *Tools / Libraries*
 * Add a new library by clicking on button *New libraries...*
 * Library name : *JBusyComponent* and Library type : *Class library* and click *Ok*
 * Tab *ClassPath*, click on button *Add Jar/Folder*, select *jbusycomponent-1.0.2.jar*
 * Tab *Sources*, click on button *Add Jar/Folder*, select *jbusycomponent-1.0.2-sources.jar*
 * Tab *Javadoc*, click on button *Add Jar/Folder*, select *jbusycomponent-1.0.2-javadoc.jar*

=== Dependencies libraries ===
JBusyComponent project requires 2 other libraries
  * SwingX 1.6 that can be downloaded [https://swingx.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=11890&expandFolder=11890&folderID=6868 here]
  * JXLayer 3.0.4 that can be downloaded [https://jxlayer.dev.java.net/#download here]

Create Netbeans's libraries in the same model than JBusyComponent for theses libraries

= Configuring you projects =
This step is required for all project that want to use JBusyComponent with the palette manager

At this time, if you try to drag'n drop this bean into your design, you will receive a *can't instanciate this bean...*. 

Your project must include the JBusyComponent library to be able to use it with the designer

 * Into you project *Properties*
 * Go to category *Libraries*
 * In tab *Compile* click into *Add library...*
 * Select *JBusyComponent* library and click on *Add Library*
