#summary Getting Starting with matisse designer (Netbeans)
#labels TODO

= Introduction =
We will introduce how use the `JBusyComponent` as a JavaBean in the palette manager.
And layout and configure the `JBusyComponent` with Matisse

= Configuring your netbeans =
Theses steps are done only one times and apply for your whole netbeans environment

== Creating required Netbeans' libraries ==

=== The JBusyComponent library ===
 * Menu *Tools / Libraries*
 * Add a new library by clicking on button *New libraries...*
 * Library name : *JBusyComponent* and Library type : *Class library* and click *Ok*
 * Tab *ClassPath*, click on button *Add Jar/Folder*, select *jbusycomponent-1.0.2.jar*
 * Tab *Sources*, click on button *Add Jar/Folder*, select *jbusycomponent-1.0.2-sources.jar*
 * Tab *Javadoc*, click on button *Add Jar/Folder*, select *jbusycomponent-1.0.2-javadoc.jar*

=== Dependencies===
JBusyComponent project requires 2 other libraries
  * SwingX 1.6 that can be downloaded [https://swingx.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=11890&expandFolder=11890&folderID=6868 here]
  * JXLayer 3.0.4 that can be downloaded [https://jxlayer.dev.java.net/#download here]

Create Netbeans's libraries in the same model than JBusyComponent for theses libraries
 * JXLayer-3.0.4 for the JXLayer
 * SwingX-1.6 for the SwingX

== Adding JBusyComponent Bean to the palette manager ==
 * Menu *Tools / Palette / Swing/Awt Components*
 * Button *Add from library*
 * Select *JBusyComponent* library and click *Next* button
 * Select *JBusyComponent* bean and click *Next* button
 * Select *Beans* category (or anything else of your choice) and click *Finish* Button

= Configuring you projects =
This step is required for all project that want to use JBusyComponent with the palette manager

At this time, if you try to drag'n drop this bean into your design, you will receive a *can't instanciate this bean...*. 

Your project must include the JBusyComponent library to be able to use it with the designer

 * Into you project *Properties*
 * Go to category *Libraries*
 * In tab *Compile* click into *Add library...*
 * Select *JBusyComponent* library and click on *Add Library*
 * Select *JXLayer-3.0.4* library and click on *Add Library*
 * Select *SwingX-1.6* library and click on *Add Library*

== Design with the palette ==
You can drag'n drop a JBusyComponent into your form. After what create the view component on you form and attach it in the *view* property of your JBusyComponent.
At this step, you can activate the *busy* property and the design will draw the busy state on you view components.
